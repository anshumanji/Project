## Abstract
A phishing attack is the simplest way to obtain sensitive information from innocent users. The aim of the phishers is to acquire critical information like username, password, and bank account details. Cybersecurity people are now looking for trustworthy and steady detection techniques for phishing website detection.

This project deals with machine learning technology for the detection of phishing URLs by extracting and analyzing various features of legitimate and phishing URLs.

Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms are used to detect phishing websites. The aim of the paper is to detect phishing URLs as well as narrow down to the best machine learning algorithm by comparing accuracy rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate of each algorithm.
## Phishing-Website-Detection

Financial industry involves an extremely high volume of real time online transactions. This makes vulnerable to fraud. Fraud detection is using security measures to prevent third parties from obtaining funds. This process involves a manual check and automated verification of transaction details to spot any unusual activity that may be a sign of attack and block it.

## Email Phishing 

Over the years there have been many attacks of Phishing and many people have lost huge sums of money by becoming a victim of phishing attack. In a phishing attack emails are sent to user claiming to be a legitimate organization, where in the email asks user to enter information like name, telephone, bank account number important passwords etc. such emails direct the user to a website where in user enters these personal information. These websites also known as phishing website now steal the entered user information and carries out illegal transactions thus causing harm to the user.Phishing website and their mails are sent to millions of users daily and thus are still a big concern for cyber security.


### Overview of the project

Phishing is one of the luring techniques used by phishing artist in the intention of exploiting the personal details of unsuspected users. Phishing website is a mock website that looks similar in appearance but different in destination. The unsuspected users post their data thinking that these websites come from trusted financial institutions. Several antiphishing techniques emerge continuously but phishers come with new technique by breaking all the antiphishing mechanisms. Hence there is a need for efficient mechanism for the prediction of phishing website.

This Project is under Construction and will be completed by May,2025
