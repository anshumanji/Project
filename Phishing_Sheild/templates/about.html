    <h1>About PhishShield</h1>
    <p>PhishShield is dedicated to protecting users from phishing threats using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Our goal is to make the internet safer for everyone. We combine security research, data science, and practical experience to deliver a trustworthy solution for real-time phishing detection.</p>

    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>A phishing attack is the simplest way to obtain sensitive information from innocent users. The aim of the phishers is to acquire critical information like username, password, and bank account details. Cybersecurity people are now looking for trustworthy and steady detection techniques for phishing website detection.</p>
    <p>This project deals with machine learning technology for the detection of phishing URLs by extracting and analyzing various features of legitimate and phishing URLs.</p>
    <p>Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine algorithms are used to detect phishing websites. The aim of the paper is to detect phishing URLs as well as narrow down to the best machine learning algorithm by comparing accuracy rate, false positive rate, and false negative rate of each algorithm.</p>

    <h2>Phishing-Website-Detection</h2>
    <p>The financial industry involves an extremely high volume of real-time online transactions. This makes it vulnerable to fraud. Fraud detection uses security measures to prevent third parties from obtaining funds. This process involves a manual check and automated verification of transaction details to spot any unusual activity that may be a sign of attack and block it.</p>

    <h2>Email Phishing</h2>
    <p>Over the years, there have been many attacks of phishing and many people have lost huge sums of money by becoming victims. In a phishing attack, emails are sent to users claiming to be from legitimate organizations, asking for personal information like name, telephone, bank account number, or passwords. These emails direct the user to a fake website, where information is collected and used for illegal transactions.</p>

    <h2>Overview of the Project</h2>
    <p>Phishing is a luring technique used by attackers to exploit personal data. A phishing website mimics a legitimate one in appearance but is hosted at a different destination. Users unknowingly share data with these fake sites. Although several anti-phishing techniques have emerged, attackers continually develop ways to bypass them. Hence, there is a need for an efficient prediction mechanism.</p>

    <p><strong>This project is under construction and will be completed by May, 2025.</strong></p>
